# About the Project

Hi! This is my first project using API endpoints. Uniting two of my passions, tech and pokémon, I made a search website, also known as a Pokedex. Using Swiper JS lib, the website displays some of information about the pokémon you want to know on each and every side of the cube.
The website contains a spinning cube, which allows the user to interact with it by grabbing and scrolling the cube right and left.
Have a nice search!

## Tutotial

- Insert the desired pokémon name or ID
- Hover the cursor over the cube (which now displays the pokémon image) and grab it (if you are using a cellphone, simply touch it)
- [Have fun!](https://hcferraz.github.io/pokedex/)

## Techs
- HTML
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript
